# Wrestlin' the Lion

Never wanted to repeat   
What already been said
  
Until I heard the owl hoot
  
That repetitions dead 

I poured it on the page
  
I sought a pigeon keeper
  
I gave him what I'd written
  
And he sent it to the reaper 

When I got reply
  
It was sealed with melted chocolate
  
I ate the letter ravenously
  
Chewing through the topics

I chewed the hand that held the letter  
Chewed the muscles tough  
I chewed the heart read in the letter  
I chewed the billy gruff

No one ever told me  
That love is in the tryin'  
It's destiny in madness  
Love is wrestling the lion 

It doesn't add up neatly  
Doesn't stack up in the storage  
To produce a juice from what you picked  
Is akin to rhymin oranges

Blast the bowl refill the pepper  
Set the spices all to savory  
Your cooking bones are stewing  
Boiling over the fires of knavery

As you set out thinking books  
Will prove a class out of your passion  
Where two divided parts could prove  
Your brain will just collapse in

So set your mark to losses  
Win the grounds you've gained  
Achievement's bleeding at the best  
Admit that you've been brained

I saw the end was nearing  
'tween the fires and the rain  
the earth beneath my body cracked  
my rages raged again

And just when I was winning  
the broken lamb was bleating  
The throbbing heart within my hands  
unfurled unto my feeling

Reality was swallowing  
all of my round assumptions  
The bosom brief of my beliefs  
consumed with royal trumpets

Above my brain the mirrored sky  
reflected back my image  
the bleeding throne became my own  
my loss became my scrimmage

I saw the line beyond beyond  
the one that I was walking to  
extend it's ends eons before  
and after all I knew

My will became a comet lost  
my us became the other  
and last were these beneath the sea  
my thoughts went drowning under
