# Living in doubt, or "Living   
I doubt" 

Without questioning, I wonder if I would go on making decisions and moving forward, being? 

The train passes by some miles away. As it curves around the city center, hugging the concrete inlets and sliding under massive cement and marble edifices, it sounds its horn. 

"I am passing through. I mean no harm. Is anyone there?"

AAARROOOOOOOOO! 

I loved living next to the trains as a child. Because like any real relationship it inconvenienced me, it shook me, it woke me up night after night into an industrial nightmare, the industrial nightmare of progress, moving forward - surfacing my fears of my own greatness.. Until one day I found ubiquity. 

AAARROOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  "Anyone?" 

And then I was a part of the train - I was the train. I felt proud and defensive, strangely badged, a survivor turned train conductor; serious, hatted, floating useful and un-noticed through the wide, wide world. 

And yet it all can go "poof" at any moment: the train and everything. My train. My everything. I am not the train. I am not one with everything. I do not trust this relationship. I cannot live like this, under the oppression of some foreign object, whistling and howling in a cage. Get me out of this confusion. Roll me over and check my pulse, am I insane?
No, that's what she would ask.
I say,"am I here?" 

AAARROOOOOOOOOO!

It's just a schedule, just a timetable, job placement, packing duty, decision-maker's wet-dream, control-freak pain-killer. "I am not one of those," I think. I think I am.

I think I'm not. 

But I am too, you must admit. What exactly drives me other than the same damn fuel the others conned somehow
I think, 

"I think I can. I think I can't. I think I can. I think I can't.." 

I think I am.
